# Workshop on Toxicity Detection in Games

## About Workshop

**Toxicity Dual Detection Workshop** will be held within the The Web Conference [(WWW)](https://www2022.thewebconf.org/) between 25th - 29th, 2022. The workshop date will be released in Dec 2021.

### Workshop Description

As the popularity of multi-player online games has grown, the phenomenon of **in-game toxic behavior** has taken root within them. Like other social platforms, toxic behavior is strongly present in recent online games and is problematic to the gaming industry. These have the effect of loss of enjoyment for players which can lead to loss of player base, and longer term self-esteem effects. Fast detection of such behaviour can enable mitigation strategies to be enacted to thwart the toxic situations.
 
An extensive body of work has focused on datasets to **detect toxicity** including hate speech and abusive language. However, the majority of toxicity datasets do not consider the context of a conversation, instead simply analysing a single utterance. In order to understand context and detect toxicity, this workshop uses **CONDA** (accepted by ACL-IJCNLP 2021), an in-game toxicity detection dataset providing **a dual-level annotation at utterance and token-level, and rich contextual chatting history**.

This workshop aims to bring together top researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to engage in a discussion about identifying and combating such toxicity behaviour. The Web Conference (WWW) offers an excellent forum for such a discussion, and we expect the workshop to be of interest to everyone in the community. 


## CONDA Dataset 

Traditional toxicity detection models have focused on the single utterance level without deeper understanding of context. The CONDA dataset is to detect in-game toxic language, **enabling joint intent classification and slot filling analysis**, which is a core task in Natural Language Understanding (NLU). The dataset consists of 45K utterances from 12K conversations from the chat logs of 1.9K completed the _Defense of the Ancients 2 (Dota 2)_ matches. Dota 2 is a multiplayer online game where teams of five players attempt to destroy their opponents' ancient structure.

### Dataset Description
The CONDA dataset consists of 9 columns - match ID, conversation ID, player ID, player slot, chat time, utterance, slot tokens (cleaned tokens with slot labelling), intent class, and slot classes.

**File descriptions**
- conda_train.csv : the training set
- conda_valid.csv : the validation set
- conda_test.csv : the test set. You are required to classify the utterance and slot labels, and then submit your predicted labels to the leader board.
- answer.csv : sample submission file in the correct format

**Column descriptions**

Columns | Descriptions
------------ | -------------
matchId| Each match has a unique ID from raw data.
conversationId | Each conversation has a unique ID generated by this research to provide guidance for human annotation.
playerId | Individual players have a unique ID from raw data.
playerSlot | Individual players have a unique number associated with their roles in each match.
chatTime | Each utterance has time (in seconds) when it appears in each match. 
utterance | Original raw data before any data processing.
slotTokens | Tokenised, cleaned, and slot labelled data.
**intentClass** | U tterance-level annotated labels - E (Explicit), I (Implicit), A (Action), and O (Other).
**slotClasses** | Token-level annotated labels - T (Toxicity), C (Character), D (Dota-specific), S (game Slang), P (Pronoun), and O (Other).

### Task & Evaluation Overview

The task is to propose and implement a model/framework for **Joint Slot and Intent Classification**. In order to conduct a multi-aspect evaluation, we will use the following four metrics; 

- **UCA** : Utterance Classification Accuracy
- **U-F1** : the break-down Utterance-F1 for each intent class - E (Explicit), I (Implicit), A (Action), O (Other)
- **T-F1** : the overall Token-F1 
- **JSA** : Joint Semantic Accuracy

The first two follow the existing traditional abusive language detection research for utterance level detection evaluation while the others are the metrics used for slot-level prediction evaluation and the joint task in NLU models. Instead of solely focusing on achieving higher performance, having a good architecture design & implementation with detailed step-by-step justification will be important to show youâ€™ve fully reached your potential in this task. 

**Submission Format**

For every intent label and slot labels in the dataset, submission files (.csv format) should contain three columns: id, intentClass, and slotClasses. intentClass should have predicted Utterance-level annotated labels - **E (Explicit), I (Implicit), A (Action), and O (Other)**. Likewise, slotClasses should have predicted Slot-level annotated labels - **T (Toxicity), C (Character), D (Dota-specific), S (game Slang), P (Pronoun), and O (Other)**.

- A submission file is your prediction results for the test set.
- You should keep the heading from the sample submission file (answer.csv): _id, intentClass, and slotClasses_. If you remove the heading, it will cause a failure to upload.
- Your submission file for CodaLab is a **".zip"** compressed file from the exact file name from **"answer.csv"**. 

The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
id, intentClass, slotClasses
1, O, O
2, O, O SEPA O P P
3, I, O O S C
```

Detailed information for the implementation and submission steps are specified in our [Codalab page](https://competitions.codalab.org/).
