## Welcome to the CONDA Challenge 2022

Traditional toxicity detection models have focused on the single utterance level without deeper understanding of context. The CONDA dataset is to detect in-game toxic language, **enabling joint intent classification and slot filling analysis**, which is a core task in Natural Language Understanding (NLU). The dataset consists of 45K utterances from 12K conversations from the chat logs of 1.9K completed the _Defense of the Ancients 2 (Dota 2)_ matches. Dota 2 is a multiplayer online game where teams of five players attempt to destroy their opponents' ancient structure.

### Dataset Description
The CONDA dataset consists of 9 columns - match ID, conversation ID, player ID, player slot, chat time, utterance, slot tokens (cleaned tokens with slot labelling), intent class, and slot classes.

**File descriptions**
- conda_train.csv : the training set
- conda_valid.csv : the validation set
- conda_test.csv : the test set. You are required to classify the utterance and slot labels, and then submit your predicted labels to the leader board.
- answer.csv : sample submission file in the correct format

**Column descriptions**

Columns | Descriptions
------------ | -------------
matchId| Each match has a unique ID from raw data.
conversationId | Each conversation has a unique ID generated by this research to provide guidance for human annotation.
playerId | Individual players have a unique ID from raw data.
playerSlot | Individual players have a unique number associated with their roles in each match.
chatTime | Each utterance has time (in seconds) when it appears in each match. 
utterance | Original raw data before any data processing.
slotTokens | Tokenised, cleaned, and slot labelled data.
**intentClass** | U tterance-level annotated labels - E (Explicit), I (Implicit), A (Action), and O (Other).
**slotClasses** | Token-level annotated labels - T (Toxicity), C (Character), D (Dota-specific), S (game Slang), P (Pronoun), and O (Other).

### Task & Evaluation Overview

The task is to propose and implement a model/framework for **Joint Slot and Intent Classification**. In order to conduct a multi-aspect evaluation, we will use the following four metrics; 

- **UCA** : Utterance Classification Accuracy
- **U-F1** : the break-down Utterance-F1 for each intent class - E (Explicit), I (Implicit), A (Action), O (Other)
- **T-F1** : the overall Token-F1 
- **JSA** : Joint Semantic Accuracy

The first two follow the existing traditional abusive language detection research for utterance level detection evaluation while the others are the metrics used for slot-level prediction evaluation and the joint task in NLU models. Instead of solely focusing on achieving higher performance, having a good architecture design & implementation with detailed step-by-step justification will be important to show youâ€™ve fully reached your potential in this task. 

**Submission Format**

For every intent label and slot labels in the dataset, submission files (.csv format) should contain three columns: id, intentClass, and slotClasses. intentClass should have predicted Utterance-level annotated labels - **E (Explicit), I (Implicit), A (Action), and O (Other)**. Likewise, slotClasses should have predicted Slot-level annotated labels - **T (Toxicity), C (Character), D (Dota-specific), S (game Slang), P (Pronoun), and O (Other)**.

- A submission file is your prediction results for the test set.
- You should keep the heading from the sample submission file (answer.csv): _id, intentClass, and slotClasses_. If you remove the heading, it will cause a failure to upload.
- Your submission file for CodaLab is a **".zip"** compressed file from the exact file name from **"answer.csv"**. 

The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
id, intentClass, slotClasses
1, O, O
2, O, O SEPA O P P
3, I, O O S C
```

Detailed information for the implementation and submission steps are specified in our [Codalab page](https://competitions.codalab.org/).
