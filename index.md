# Workshop on Toxicity Detection in Games

## About Workshop

**Toxicity Dual Detection Workshop** will be held within the The Web Conference [(WWW)](https://www2022.thewebconf.org/) between 25th - 29th, 2022. The workshop date will be released in Dec 2021.

### Workshop Description

As the popularity of multi-player online games has grown, the phenomenon of **in-game toxic behavior** has taken root within them. Like other social platforms, toxic behavior is strongly present in recent online games and is problematic to the gaming industry. These have the effect of loss of enjoyment for players which can lead to loss of player base, and longer term self-esteem effects. Fast detection of such behaviour can enable mitigation strategies to be enacted to thwart the toxic situations.
 
An extensive body of work has focused on datasets to **detect toxicity** including hate speech and abusive language. However, the majority of toxicity datasets do not consider the context of a conversation, instead simply analysing a single utterance. In order to understand context and detect toxicity, this workshop uses **CONDA** (accepted by ACL-IJCNLP 2021), an in-game toxicity detection dataset providing **a dual-level annotation at utterance and token-level, and rich contextual chatting history**.

This workshop aims to bring together top researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to engage in a discussion about identifying and combating such toxicity behaviour. The Web Conference (WWW) offers an excellent forum for such a discussion, and we expect the workshop to be of interest to everyone in the community. 


## CONDA Dataset 

Traditional toxicity detection models have focused on the single utterance level without deeper understanding of context. The CONDA dataset is to detect in-game toxic language, **enabling joint intent classification and slot filling analysis**, which is a core task in Natural Language Understanding (NLU). The dataset consists of 45K utterances from 12K conversations from the chat logs of 1.9K completed the _Defense of the Ancients 2 (Dota 2)_ matches. Dota 2 is a multiplayer online game where teams of five players attempt to destroy their opponents' ancient structure.
